# Calculating Grades

# Write a program that will average 3 numeric exam grades, return an average test score,
# a corresponding letter grade, and a message stating whether the student is passing.

# Average    Grade
# 90+        A
# 80-89      B
# 70-79      C
# 60-69      D
# 0-59       F

# Example 1:
# Exams: 89, 90, 90
# Average: 90
# Grade: A
# Student is passing.

# Example 2:
# Exams: 50, 51, 0
# Average: 33
# Grade: F
# Student is failing.

# Get exam grades from user input
exam_one = int(input("Input exam grade one: "))
exam_two = int(input("Input exam grade two: "))  # Fixed: added int() and removed extra parenthesis
exam_three = int(input("Input exam grade three: "))  # Fixed: consistent variable name and int conversion

# Create list of grades
grades = [exam_one, exam_two, exam_three]  # Fixed: added commas and correct variable name

# Calculate average
total = 0  # Changed variable name from 'sum' (sum is a built-in function)
for grade in grades:  # Fixed: corrected variable name 'grade' to 'grades'
    total += grade  # Simplified addition

avg = total / len(grades)

# Determine letter grade
if avg >= 90:
    letter_grade = "A"
elif 80 <= avg < 90:  # Simplified condition
    letter_grade = "B"
elif 70 <= avg < 80:  # Simplified condition
    letter_grade = "C"
elif 60 <= avg < 70:  # Fixed: corrected range for D
    letter_grade = "D"
else:  # Fixed: removed condition after elif
    letter_grade = "F"

# Print results
print("Exams:", ", ".join(str(grade) for grade in grades))  # Improved formatting
print("Average:", avg)
print("Grade:", letter_grade)

# Determine passing status
if letter_grade == "F":  # Fixed: corrected comparison operator and hyphen to underscore
    print("Student is failing.")  # Added parentheses for print
else:
    print("Student is passing.")
